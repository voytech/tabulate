An utility written in Kotlin/JVM for simplifying data export to tabular file formats.

# Why ?

Because Kotlin DSL makes it desirable.

# When ?    

If You need to dump collection of objects into following formats: 
- excel (xlsx), 
- csv,
- pdf,
- ... (here goes all future implementations)

and want to:
 - have control over table styles ( on table, column, row and cell level), 
 - add custom, leading, trailing or even interleaving rows (e.g. column headers, footer with summaries, or divider-like data rows ),
 - use compact, simple, type-safe DSL for that.  

# How ?

By using: 
- simple table domain model,
- plugable attributes (for styles, format-specific features),
- type-safe DSL builders,
- built-in renderers implementations (excel, pdf, csv) delegating to 3rd party libraries.
